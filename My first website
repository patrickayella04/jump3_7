My very first website attempt was a blind build.
I picked a website I liked the look of and without looking at any of its source code, I built it again. 
This is the name of the original website: https://ilfordbjj.webnode.com/. 
Each line of code I Wrote was searched out and studied to see how and why it worked. 
By owning my understanding of the code, as simple as the code may be, I was able to implement that code to achieve the closest resemblance possible. 
Not only visually but also in functionality and responsivness.
