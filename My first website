My first every website attempt was a blind build.
I picked a website I liked the look of and without looking at any of its source code, I built it again. 
This is the name of the original website: https://ilfordbjj.webnode.com/
Every single piece of code I had go and search out and study how and why it worked. 
In order to make sure I was able to implement that code to achieve the closest resemblance. Not only visually but also 
in functionality and responsivness.
